# java-ai-minefield-navigator

Package provides java implementation of a multi-agent learning simulator based on FALCON ANN and RL

# Introduction 

TD-FALCON is a fusion architecture that incorporates temporal difference methods and self-organizing neural networks for reinforcement learning with delayed rewards. It learns by creating cognitive codes across sensory input, actions, and rewards.

The implementation of TD-FALCON can be found in the minefield navigation simulator in this java project, alongside with its reactive version R-FALCON, and a backpropagation network based Q-learning system.
